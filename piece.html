    <p> I am going to list some of my coping skills and write how they help me.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2> <p style="font-weight: bold;">
   1. Stop listening or watching the news
</h2>
<p>
    Constantly listening to the news and hearing all the horrible things that are happening can be incredibly stressful. So, take a break from the news and do something that makes you happy.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3> <p style="font-weight: bold;">
   2. Take a hot/ cold shower
</h3>
<p>
      Taking a shower is a great way to clear things out. I take hot showers but sometimes I make it cold to shock my system and wake me up.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h4><p style="font-weight: bold;">
    3. Talk to someone you trust
</h4>
<p>
    Talking about your feelings to someone you trust and feel comfortable can really help. You can get another opinion on a situation, that isn't yours, and they can give you some coping skills to help.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h5> <p style="font-weight: bold;">
   4. Journal
</h5>
<p>
   Sometimes you may not want to talk to people, so what I recommend doing it writing things down. I have a book with the sole purpose to write my sad thoughts in.
   It is a good way to process my emotions in the moment.
</p>
<p>

</p>

  5. Watch something cute or funny
</h6>
<p>
  Here are some things I have been watching this week. I highly recommend watching Space Force it is so funny!
