    COVID-19 and quarantine can have severe effects on our mental health. It is important that we take care of our mental health because our mental health is just as important as our physical health. I made this website because when I was talking to my friends I realized we were all going through a range of emotions and some of them did not know how to cope. Hopefully, you use some of these coping skills or develop some of your own to help cope with quarantine.</h8>
